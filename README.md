# RasPi-Vex-Feild-Controller
**Welcome To My VEX Feild Controller Repository,**

**This Repo Details How To Make A Vex Feild Controller With A Timer Countdown On A Monitor That Is Activated With Vex Bumper Switches Or Other Buttons**


The Fritzing file that is included required open source software that can be downloaded from the fritzing website.  Included in the fritzing file is a wiring diagram, PCB file and skematic diagram.  A full wiring diagram will become avalable soon..  The code is written in python 3 on a raspberry pi, because of this problems with the GPIO lib may be experienced when editing code on something not Raspberry pi.
