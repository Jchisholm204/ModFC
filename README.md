# RasPi-Vex-Field-Controller
**Welcome To My VEX Feild Controller Repository,**

**This Repo Details How To Make A Vex Field Controller With A Timer Countdown On A Monitor That Is Activated With Vex Bumper Switches Or Other Buttons**


The Fritzing file that is included required open source software that can be downloaded from the fritzing website.  Included in the fritzing file is a wiring diagram, PCB file and skematic diagram.  A full wiring diagram is now avalible inside the ButtonsFC folder, indide this folder there is wiring diagrams included for the pi and for the driver interface.  The code is written in python 3 on a raspberry pi, because of this problems with the GPIO lib may be experienced when editing code on non-Pi devices.


**REQUIRED MATERIALS:**

1 Raspberry pi, perferably a 3B+

2 Relays, low voltage would be best but any relays that will work with Aurduino or Raspberry Pi will work

2 RJ45 jacks, these will be used to connect into the driver interfaces

2 Long 8-pin/cat 5E RJ45 cables, these will plug into the RJ45 ports on the interfaces and your ButtonFC

6 Female to Female jumper cables for connecting the Pi to the Relays

14 Female to Male jumper cables  (6 if you dont plan on doing skills runs)

4 Male to Male jumper cables

4 Buttons, I'm using VEX EDR Buttons for this project but any buttons will work

1 Small Breadbord

Lexan/ABS/Acrylic Material, To make a case

**ALL MATERIALS IN THIS LIST ARE NOT FINALIZED AND ARE SPECIFIC TO MY SETUP, YOU MAY REQUIRE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PARTS FOR YOURS**
